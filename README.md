# Adventist Hymnal Project

This project provides the lyrics for the Seventh-day Adventist Hymnal in various digital formats, making them easily accessible for churches, groups, and individuals. The goal is to offer these resources freely for use in worship services, presentations, and other related activities.

## File Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `raw_text/`: Contains the raw text files for each hymn, with a simple format of hymn number, title, and lyrics. This is the source data for all other formats.
-   `chordpro/`: Contains the hymns in ChordPro format, a plain text file format for chords and lyrics. These files are generated from the `raw_text` files.
-   `ProPresenter/`: Contains files formatted for import into ProPresenter, a popular church presentation software. These files are also generated from the `raw_text` files.
-   `convert_to_chordpro.py`: A Python script that converts the text files from the `raw_text` directory into ChordPro format.
-   `genProPresenter.rb`: A Ruby script that converts the text files from the `raw_text` directory into a format suitable for ProPresenter.

## Output Formats

### ChordPro

The ChordPro files (`.cho`) are generated by the `convert_to_chordpro.py` script. They include metadata for the hymn title and number, and the verses are structured with `{start_of_verse}` and `{end_of_verse}` tags.

### ProPresenter

The ProPresenter files (`.txt`) are generated by the `genProPresenter.rb` script. These files are formatted for easy import into ProPresenter, with slides separated by newlines and groups for "Intro," "Verse," and "Chorus."

## Usage

To generate the output files, you can run the provided scripts.

### Generating ChordPro Files

To create the ChordPro files, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python convert_to_chordpro.py
```

This will process the files in the `raw_text` directory and save the output to the `chordpro` directory.

### Generating ProPresenter Files

To create the ProPresenter files, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ruby genProPresenter.rb
```

This will process the files in the `raw_text` directory and save the output to the `ProPresenter` directory.
