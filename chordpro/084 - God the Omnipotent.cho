{title: God the Omnipotent - 84}

{start_of_verse}
God the Omnipotent! King,
who ordainest
Great winds Thy clarions,
the lightnings Thy sword;
Show forth Thy pity
on high where Thou reignest,
Give to us peace,
O most merciful Lord.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
God the all merciful!
earth hath forsaken
Thy precepts holy,
and slighted Thy word;
Bid not Thy wrath
in its terrors awaken;
Give to us peace,
O most merciful Lord.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
God the all righteousness One!
man hath defied Thee;
Yet to eternity
standeth Thy word;
Falsehood and wrong
shall not tarry beside Thee;
Prosper the right,
O most merciful Lord.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
So shall we render
Thee thankful devotion,
For Thy deliverance
from peril and sword,
Singing in chorus
from ocean to ocean,
“Thine is the power
and the glory, O Lord.”
{end_of_verse}
