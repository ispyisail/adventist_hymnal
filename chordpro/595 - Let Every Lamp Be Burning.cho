{title: Let Every Lamp Be Burning - 595}

{start_of_verse}
Let every lamp be burning bright,
The darkest hour is nearing;
The darkest hour of earth’s long night,
Before the Lord’s appearing.
Refrain
Then trim your lamps, my brethren dear,
Then trim your lamps with godly fear;
The Master’s coming draweth near,
Let every lamp be burning.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Though thousands calmly slumber on,
The last great message spuring,
Wel’ll rest our living faith upon
His promise of returning.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
His word our lamp, His truth our guide,
We cannot be mistaken;
Though dangers rise on every side,
We shall not be forsaken.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Then let good works with faith appear,
To help the world atound us;
Obedience bring the blessing near
When faith has firmly bound us.
