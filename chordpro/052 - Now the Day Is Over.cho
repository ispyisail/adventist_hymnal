{title: Now the Day Is Over - 52}

{start_of_verse}
Now the day is over,
night is drawing nigh,
Shadows of the evening
steal across the sky.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Father, give the weary,
calm and sweet repose;
With Thy tenderest blessing
May our eyelids close.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Through the long night watches,
may thine angels spread
Their white wings above me,
watching round my bed.
