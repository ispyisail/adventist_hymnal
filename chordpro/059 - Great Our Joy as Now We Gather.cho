{title: Great Our Joy as Now We Gather - 59}

{start_of_verse}
Great our joy as now we gather
Where the Master makes us one:
Where we worship God the Father
Thro’ the Spirit of His Son.
All who search for His church
Find it where His will is done.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Precious is the tie that binds us
To our God when faith grows cold;
Precious all that now reminds us
He is still our safe stronghold.
Faithful love serves to prove
Here the Shepherd has His fold.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
May we learn from Christ’s example
How to use this house of prayer:
He who loved and cleansed His temple
Wants us all to worship there.
God the Son shuts out none:
In His kingdom all may share.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Lord, inspire us with Your vision
Of a world which must be won!
Glorious is the church’s mission,
Long endeavoured, scarce begun!
Faithful now – this is how
God’s eternal will is done.
