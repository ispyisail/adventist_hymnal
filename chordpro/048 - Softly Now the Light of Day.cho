{title: Softly Now the Light of Day - 48}

{start_of_verse}
Softly now the light of day
Fades upon out sight away:
Free from care, from labor free,
Lord, we would commune with Thee.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Thou, whose allpervading eye
Nought escapes, without, within,
Pardon each infirmity,
Open fault, and secret sin.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Soon from us the light of day
Shall forever pass away;
Then, from sin and sorrow free,
Take us, Lord, to dwell with Thee.
{end_of_verse}
