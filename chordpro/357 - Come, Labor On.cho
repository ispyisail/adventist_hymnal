{title: Come, Labor On - 357}

{start_of_verse}
Come, labor on.
Who dares stand idle on the harvest plain
While all around him waves the golden grain?
And to each servant does the Master say,
“Go work today.”
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Come, labor on.
Claim the high calling angels cannot share;
To young and old the gospel gladness bear;
Redeem the time; its hours too swiftly fly.
The night draws nigh.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Come, labor on.
No time for rest; till glows the western sky,
Till the long shadows oér our pathway lie,
And a glad sound comes with the setting sun,
“Well done, well done!”
