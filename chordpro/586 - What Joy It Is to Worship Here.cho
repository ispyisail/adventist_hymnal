{title: What Joy It Is to Worship Here - 586}

{start_of_verse}
What joy it is to worship here,
And find ourselves at home,
Where God, who uses every gift,
Has room for all who come!
{end_of_verse}

Yet are no two of us alike
Of all the human race,
And we must seek a common ground
If we would share His grace.
