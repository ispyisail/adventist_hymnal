{title: My Soul, Be on Thy Guard - 605}

{start_of_verse}
My soul, be on they guard!
Ten thousand foes arise;
The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw thee from the skies.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
O watch, and fight, and pray!
The battle ne’er give o’er;
Renew it boldly every day,
And help divine implore.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Ne’er think the victory won,
Nor lay thine armor down;
Thy arduous task will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown.
