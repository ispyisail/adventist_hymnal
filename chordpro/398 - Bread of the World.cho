{title: Bread of the World - 398}

{start_of_verse}
Bread of the world in mercy broken,
Wine of the soul in mercy shed,
By whom the words of life are spoken,
And in whose death our sins are dead;
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Look on the heart by sorrow broken,
Look on the tears by sinners shed;
And be Thy feast to us the token
That by Thy grace our souls are fed. Amen.
{end_of_verse}
